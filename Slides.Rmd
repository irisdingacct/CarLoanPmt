## Car Loan Calculator
**Need a app on your phone handy when comparing car loan or simply want to find out how much**
**you should be paying each month for your new ride**

*No Problem, we got it covered*

**Here is what we can do for you**

## The monthly car loan payment app - beta

Simply put in the customized interest rate, choose a loan term between 1-7 years, and the total loan amount between AUD10,000 - AUD100,000. 
***Range based on one of the big four bank's offer in AU***

E.g.: Borrow $30,000 today, 6 year term @ 3% p.a. interest, estimated monthly repayment will be AUD455. Maybe a compact SUV?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(miniUI)
carloan <- function(P, I, Y){
    ui <- miniPage(
        gadgetTitleBar("Car Loan"),
        miniContentPanel(
            numericInput("I", "Interest Rate %p.a.", 
                         value = 20, min = 1, max = 20, step = 0.1),
            sliderInput("Y", "Over how many years?", 
                        1, 7, value = 7, step = 1),
            sliderInput("P", "How much would you like to borrow", 
                        10000, 100000, value = 20000, step =1000),
            
        )
    )
    server <- function(input, output, session){
        observeEvent(input$done, {
            P <- as.numeric(input$P)
            I <- as.numeric(input$I)
            Y <- as.numeric(input$Y)
            stopApp((P*(I/1200)/(1-(1+I/1200)^(-Y*12))))
        })
    }
    runGadget(ui, server)

}

carloan(10000:100000, 1:7, 1:20)

```
